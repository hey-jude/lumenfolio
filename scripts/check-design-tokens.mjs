 * Budgets here are ceilings on what survived the migration, not targets: they
 * only ever move down.

 * Colors in <script> blocks are ignored on purpose. Those feed sigma, canvas and
 * PDF.js, where a CSS variable would not resolve — and an annotation's color
 * belongs to the saved document, not to the app's theme.
